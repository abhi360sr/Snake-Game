# Snake-Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented in Java using a GUI. The player controls a snake that moves on a grid, aiming to eat randomly appearing apples. Each apple eaten makes the snake longer, increasing the game's difficulty as the player must avoid hitting the walls or the snake's tail.
